title: Implement and Apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier -- Exercise
---

I am currently listening to the lectures for 
[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=1)
I will post my solutions to the [programming exercises](http://cs231n.github.io/) attached with this course here.

In this exercise we are asked to train a loss function for the SVM classifier 
on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

### Linear Classifier for Images

According to [lecture notes](http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/), we define the 
score function as

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(x_i,W) = Wx_i
\end{align*}
$$

In the CIFAR-10 example, *x_i* is 3073x1 - with the dimension holding the constant 1.

In an expanded format this is what the matrix multiplication will look like:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
W_{0,0} & W_{0,1} & \dots & W_{0,3073} \\
W_{1,0} & W_{1,1} & \dots & W_{1,3073} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
W_{9,0} & W_{9,1} & \dots & W_{9,3073} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
X_{i,0} \\
X_{i,1} \\
\vdots \\
X_{i,3072} \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
f(i,0) \\
f(i,1) \\
\vdots \\
f{i,9}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

where *f(i,0)* is the score for image *i* belonging to class 0, *f(i,1)* is the 
score for image *i* belonging to class 1, and so on.
